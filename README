1. Introduction
---------------

The MBFL  is a  collection of  shell functions for  the GNU  Bash shell.
This package  is an attempt  to make Bash  a viable solution  for medium
sized scripts; it needs at least Bash version 4.3.

  This package relies on the  facilities of the packages: GNU Coreutils,
sudo.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

To install from  a proper release tarball, after  unpacking the archive,
do this:

    $ cd mbfl-2.2.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  We want to check the following configuration options:

--with-sudo=/path/to/sudo
   Allows the selection  of the pathname to the  executable "sudo"; this
   pathname   is   hard-coded  in   the   library.    It  defaults   to:
   /usr/bin/sudo.

--with-whoami=/path/to/whoami
   Allows  the selection  of the  pathname to  the executable  "whoami",
   which is meant to be the program from the package GNU Coreutils; this
   pathname is hard-coded in the library.  It defaults to: /bin/whoami.

--with-id=/path/to/id
   Allows the selection of the pathname to the executable "id", which is
   meant to be the program from the package GNU Coreutils; this pathname
   is hard-coded in the library.  It defaults to: /bin/id.

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  Github
site): we must  install the GNU Autotools (GNU  Automake, GNU Autoconf),
then  we must  first run  the script  "autogen.sh" from  the top  source
directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mbfl
    $ sh autogen.sh

we  should   now  see   the  executable   "configure"  script   and  the
"Makefile.in" file.  From now on everything  is the same as for building
from a proper release tarball, but we have to run the "configure" script
enabling the maintainer mode:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make install

  After building the package, and before  installing it, we can test the
example scripts as follows:

    $ make test-template MFLAGS='--help'

will run "examples/template.sh" with the flags "--help";

    $ make test-template-actions MFLAGS='one green gas --help'

will run "examples/template-actions.sh" selection  the action "one green
gas" and appending the flags "--help".


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation in Texinfo format.


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the time.

Github site.
