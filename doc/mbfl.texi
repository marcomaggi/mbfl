@chapter Overview of the package


This document describes version @value{VERSION} of @value{PACKAGE}, a library of functions for the
@gnu{} Bash shell.  This package is an attempt to make @gnu{} Bash a viable solution for medium
sized scripts; it needs at least Bash version @value{REQUIRED_BASH_VERSION}.  A set of modules
implementing common operations and a script template are offered by this package and the author has
used them with success in implementing non--small scripts.

The philosophy of @mbfl{} is to do the work as much as possible without external commands.  For
example: string manipulation is done using the special variable substitution provided by Bash, and
no use is done of utilities like @command{sed}, @command{grep} and @command{ed}.

The library is better used starting from the template scripts in the @file{examples/} subdirectory
of the distribution, especially @file{template.sh} and @file{template-actions.sh}.  This is because,
with @mbfl{}, some choices are made to reduce the application--dependent part of the script to the
smallest dimension; if we follow another schema, @mbfl{} modules may be inadequate.  This is
especially true for the options parsing module.

Starting with version 3: this package installs files under directories @strong{without} the version
part.  If we desire to install multiple versions of the package: we should install under
@file{/opt/mbfl/$(VERSION)}, by using the appropriate command line option at configuration time:

@example
$ ./configure \
      --prefix=/opt/mbfl/3.0.0 \
      --libdir=/opt/mbfl/3.0.0/lib64
@end example

@c page
@node overview quick
@section Quick run--time loading


The easiest way to use the library is to include at run--time the library file @file{libmbfl.sh} in
the script.  To do it, we install the package on the system and use this code in the scripts:

@example
source "$@{MBFL_LIBRARY:=$(type -p mbfl-config &>/dev/null \
   && mbfl-config)@}"
@end example

@noindent
after the service variables have been declared.  @ref{service variables, Required user defined
variables}.

This code will read the full pathname of the library from the environment variable
@env{MBFL_LIBRARY}; if this variable is not set: the script @command{mbfl-config} is invoked with no
arguments to acquire the pathname.  @command{mbfl-config} is installed by the package in the
@code{$(bindir)} directory, which we must include in the @env{PATH} environment variable.

@c page
@node overview reliable
@section Reliable run--time loading


A more reliable way to load the library is:

@smallexample
@verbatiminclude loader.sh
@end smallexample

@noindent
where the value of @code{mbfl_HARDCODED} can be the pathname of a known location in which to find
the library.  This code:

@enumerate
@item
Looks for the pathname in the @env{MBFL_LIBRARY} variable, to allow us to explicitly select the file
from the command line; example:

@example
$ MBFL_LIBRARY=/path/to/libmbfl.sh script.sh
@end example

@item
Looks in some known directory; for example a subdirectory of a software package that we have
distributed.

@item
As a last resort tries to evaluate the @command{mbfl-config} script to pick up a library installed
on the system.
@end enumerate

We see that the output of the @command{source} command is discarded: this is because we assume that:

@itemize
@item
If an error occurs evaluating the library a lot of error messages may fill the screen, confusing the
user; we just want a single error message pointing the finger of blame.

@item
An error in the evaluation of the library code can be replicated because the evaluation does not
heavily depend on the environment, so we can track down library errors later.
@end itemize

This code is included in the @mbfl{} distribution in the @file{src/lib/loader.sh} file; we can also
automatically include it in a script with the preprocessor macro @code{mbfl_library_loader}.

@c page
@node overview direct
@section Direct inclusion


Another solution is to directly include the library in the script; this is easy if we preprocess our
scripts with @gnu{} @mfour{}.  We only need to put the following in the script:

@example
m4_include(libmbfl.sh)
@end example

@noindent
then preprocess the script with:

@example
$ m4 --prefix-builtins --include=/path/to/library \
         script.sh.m4 >script.sh
@end example

@noindent
easy to do in a @file{Makefile}.  The installation directory pathname of the library
(@file{/path/to/library} in the example) is the output of @code{mbfl-config --libpath}.

It is also interesting to process the script with the following rule of @gnu{} Make: assuming that
the source scripts are in the @file{src/modules} directory of the source tree:

@example
vpath	%.sh.m4		$(srcdir)/src/modules

M4      = ...
M4FLAGS = --prefix-builtins --include=/path/to/library

%.sh: %.sh.m4
        $(M4) $(M4FLAGS) $(<) | \
        grep --invert-match -e '^#' -e '^$$' | \
        sed -e "s/^ \\+//" >$(@@)
@end example

@noindent
this will remove all the comments and blank lines, decreasing the size of the script significantly
if one makes use of verbose comments; note that this will wipe out the @code{#!/bin/bash} first
line, too.

Usually we want the script to begin with @code{#!/bin/bash} followed by a comment describing the
license terms.  We can do it by preparing a script like the following:

@example
#!/bin/bash
# ... license ...

m4_include(realscript.sh)

### end of file
@end example

@noindent
and processing it with the following makefile rule:

@example
M4      = ...
M4FLAGS = --prefix-builtins --include=/path/to/library

script.sh: script.sh.m4 realscript.sh
        $(M4) $(M4FLAGS) $(<) >$(@@)
@end example

@noindent
@file{realscript.sh} can be processed as explained above.

At this point, though, it is better to use the @mbfl{} preprocessor.  @ref{preprocessor, Using the
script preprocessor}.

@c page
@node overview interactive
@section Using the library interactively


It is possible, but not recommended, to source the library in an interactive shell, though some
modules must be disabled.  The purpose of interactive loading is only to test and debug the
functions by hand.

To do this execute the following code in the shell before sourcing the library:

@example
mbfl_INTERACTIVE=yes
@end example

@noindent
without exporting the variable.  The ``dangerous'' blocks of code in the library are surrounded by:

@example
if test "$mbfl_INTERACTIVE" != 'yes'
then
    ...
fi
@end example

@noindent
so they are not executed.  Disabled modules are: main, actions, getopts, signal; ``disabled'' does
not mean that the functions are not there: only the global variable declarations are excluded; this
is a little dirty, but, at present, it should work.

@c page
@node overview rv
@section Result variables


Some functions have a @code{_var} variant; for example, two functions exists to extract the filename
extension:

@example
mbfl_file_extension
mbfl_file_extension_var
@end example

@noindent
the first variant will print the result to stdout, while the @code{_var} variant will store the
result in a ``result variable'' whose name is handed to it as first argument; this mechanism is
built using the @code{local -n} feature of Bash.  Example:

@example
mbfl_file_extension /path/to/file.ext
@print{} ext

local _RV
mbfl_file_extension_var _RV /path/to/file.ext
"$_RV"  @result{} ext
@end example

The @code{_var} variants are often a bit faster because the output variant is often a wrapper for
the @code{_var} variant.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Dangers of result variables

@strong{We must be careful when using this feature!}  Let's consider this script:

@example
function main () @{
    local -i X=0
    mbfl_func X
    echo X=$X >&2
@}
function mbfl_func () @{
    local -n Y=$@{1:?@}
    Y=1
@}

main
@end example

@noindent
everything is fine: the script will print @code{X=1} because the call to @code{mbfl_func} will
mutate the variable @code{X} in its execution environment, and such variable happens to be defined
in the scope of @code{main}.

Now let's consider this script:

@example
function main () @{
    local -i X=0
    mbfl_func X
    echo X=$X >&2
@}
function mbfl_func () @{
    local -n Y=$@{1:?@}
    local X
    Y=1
@}

main
@end example

@noindent
it will print @code{X=0} because @code{mbfl_func} accesses the variable @code{X} in its execution
environment, and such variable is defined by @code{mbfl_func} itself; the local definition of
@code{X} shadows the upper level definition.

There is no true escape from this problem!  There is no definitive way to avoid ``fishing'' a local
variable in a lower function from an upper function.  @mbfl{} attempts to mitigate the problem by
prefixing its variables with @code{mbfl_} when a function uses reference variables.  We should also
prefix our ``result variables'', for example with a leading or trailing underscore: @mbfl{} never
uses such a prefix or suffix.

So we should write the script as follows:

@example
function main () @{
    local -i _X=0
    mbfl_func _X
    echo _X=$_X >&2
@}
function mbfl_func () @{
    local -n mbfl_Y=$@{1:?@}
    local mbfl_X
    mbfl_Y=1
@}

main
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Using the preprocessor


@mbfl{}'s preprocessor has facilities to help us create variables with unique names that we can
safely use as argument to functions, @ref{preprocessor, Using the script preprocessor}.

With these facilities, the first example should be written as:

@example
mbfl_local_varref(RV)

mbfl_file_extension_var mbfl_datavar(RV) /path/to/file.ext
"$RV"  @result{} ext
@end example

@noindent
and the demo script as:

@example
function main () @{
    mbfl_local_varref(X, 0, -i)
    mbfl_func mbfl_datavar(X)
    echo X=$X >&2
@}
function mbfl_func () @{
    local -n Y=$@{1:?@}
    Y=1
@}

main
@end example

Using such preprocessor facilities consumes some computation time; they should be used when we do
not care about execution time and when such time is significantly less than running a subshell.
Otherwise we should just run the functions in a subshell:

@example
RESULT=$(mbfl_file_extension /path/to/file.ext)

"$RESULT" @result{} ext
@end example

@c page
@node overview notes
@section Notes


When using @mbfl{} we want to be aware of the following:

@itemize
@item
When in doubt about some functions work: we should take a look at the source code.  When doing this
we must remember that: there is no word splitting when performing variable assignment; so there is
no need to use double quotes in the following cases:

@example
alpha=$beta
alpha=$@{beta:1:3@}
alpha=$@{beta:-$gamma@}
alpha=$@{#beta@}
@end example

There is also no word splitting when evaluating the @var{WORD} in the @code{case} statement; so
there is no need to use double quotes in the following case:

@example
case $WORD in
  ...
esac
@end example

@item
Some functions take a variable name as argument and store in the referenced variable some value; to
avoid name collision: select a name that starts with @code{p_}.  It is guaranteed that @mbfl{} never
uses variables with name starting with such a prefix.

@item
The @code{read} built in does word splitting on the text it reads, even when there is a single
output variable.  We can verify it with:

@example
printf '\tciao\n' | @{
    read line
    echo line was "'$line'"
@}
@print{} line was 'ciao'
@end example

@noindent
we see that the initial tabulation character has been stripped, because it is a character in the
default value of @code{IFS}.  Word splitting does not happen when we set @code{IFS} to the empty
string:

@example
printf '\tciao\n' | @{
    IFS= read line
    echo line was "'$line'"
@}
@print{} line was '        ciao'
@end example

To avoid the mutation of text read with @code{read}, @mbfl{} always sets @code{IFS} to the empty
string in the environment in which @code{read} is evaluated.  This happens in functions like
@func{mbfl_read_maybe_null} and @func{mbfl_dialog_ask_password}; notice, though, that these
functions @strong{do not} mutate the @code{IFS} value in the environment of the caller.
@end itemize

@c page
@node preprocessor
@chapter Using the script preprocessor


The @mbfl{} script preprocessor is a command line program named @command{mbflpp.sh}; it is itself a
Bash script that makes use of the @mbfl{} library.  It can remove comments, blank lines, blank
characters at the beginning of lines, and it can expand macros.

The macro preprocessing is done with the @gnu{} @mfour{} program, using a library of macros called
@file{preprocessor.m4} which is installed on the system with the @mbfl{} package.

The use of the preprocessor is fully optional: every feature of the @mbfl{} library can be used
without the preprocessor.

@c page
@node preprocessor invoking
@section Invoking the preprocessor


The basic synopsis is:

@smallexample
mbflpp.sh [options] <INFILE >OUTFILE
mbflpp.sh [options] --outfile=OUTFILE [--] INFILE1 INFILE2 ...
@end smallexample

@noindent
all the @code{INFILE} pathnames are interpreted as files to concatenate in the specified order.

All the @mbfl{} built in command line options are available, additionally the following options are
supported.

@table @code
@item --preserve-comments
Do not filter out comments.

@item --add-bash
Add @code{#!$BASH} at the beginning of the output, where @code{BASH} is the built--in variable of
Bash, @bashref{Bash Variables, BASH}.

@item --bash-program=BASH
Select the absolute file pathname of the Bash executable to use when the @option{--add-bash} is
used.  It defaults to the Bash used to run the preprocessor script itself.

@item -DNAME[=VALUE]
@itemx --define=NAME[=VALUE]
Define a new symbol (@mfour{} syntax).  This is equivalent to the @option{--define} option of
@mfour{}.

@item -IVALUE
@itemx --include=VALUE
Add a search path for files.  @code{VALUE} must be a directory pathname and it is handed to @mfour{}
to search for macro files.  We can use this option multiple times.

@item --library=VALUE
Include an @mfour{} library.  @code{VALUE} must be the name of an @mfour{} macro file which is
evaluated before the input files.

@item -oVALUE
@itemx --output=VALUE
Select an output file, @code{-} for stdout.

@item -e
@itemx --eval
Send the result of preprocessing to @bash{}, rather than print it.

@item --no-prepro
Do not load the installed preprocessor's macros library.  If we use this option: we are meant to use
the option @option{--library} to load a replacement macros library from a known location.
@end table

@c page
@node preprocessor quoting
@section Quotes and quoted macro names


The @mfour{} preprocessor is invoked by @command{mbflpp.sh} with the @option{--prefix-builtins}
option; so all the @mfour{} built in macros and directives are available prefixed with @code{m4_}.

The quoting for the preprocessor is changed with:

@example
m4_changequote(`[[[', `]]]')
@end example

@c page
@node preprocessor defines
@section Predefined symbols


The preprocessor predefines the following symbols.


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} __PACKAGE_VERSION__
Expands into the version number of this package.
@end deffn


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} __PACKAGE_DATADIR__
Expands into the absolute pathname of the directory under which the @value{PACKAGE} library is
installed.  For example:

@example
/usr/local/share/mbfl
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} __MBFL_LIBRARY__
Expands into the absolute pathname of the @value{PACKAGE} library file.  For example:

@example
/usr/local/share/mbfl/libmbfl.sh
@end example
@end deffn

@c page
@node preprocessor library
@section Loading or including the library


We can include in scripts the code needed to source the library at run--time or the whole library
itself.


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} mbfl_embed_library
Expands into the contents of the library file.  The selected library is the one used by the
preprocessor script @command{mbflpp.sh} itself.  The resulting output script does not need to load
the library at runtime; let's say it is ``statically linked''.
@end deffn


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} mbfl_library_loader (@var{hardcoded_pathname})
Expand to a block of code that reliably loads the @value{PACKAGE} library.  The optional argument
@var{hardcoded_pathname} must be the absolute pathname to a file containing the library itself.
@ref{overview reliable} for details.
@end deffn

@c page
@node preprocessor parameters
@section Function parameters handling


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} mbfl_mandatory_parameter @var{varname} @var{number} @var{description}
Define a variable local to a shell function holding an argument to the function.  @var{varname} is
the name of the variable; @var{number} is the positional parameter number; @var{description} is a
description of the argument.

Example, the following:

@example
mbfl_mandatory_parameter(PATHNAME, 2, file pathname)
@end example

@noindent
is expanded to:

@smallexample
local PATHNAME=$@{2:?"missing file pathname parameter to '$FUNCNAME'"@}
@end smallexample

Another example the following function:

@example
function message () @{
  mbfl_mandatory_parameter(PROGNAME, 1, program name)
  mbfl_mandatory_parameter(STRING,   2, message string)

  printf '%s: %s\n' "$PROGNAME" "$STRING"
@}
@end example

@noindent
is expanded to:

@smallexample
function message () @{
  local PROGNAME=$@{1:?"missing program name parameter to '$FUNCNAME'"@}
  local STRING=$@{2:?"missing message string parameter to '$FUNCNAME'"@}

  printf '%s: %s\n' "$PROGNAME" "$STRING"
@}
@end smallexample

@noindent
and so it is a function with two mandatory parameters.
@end deffn


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} mbfl_mandatory_nameref_parameter @var{name} @var{number} @var{description}
Similar to @func{mbfl_mandatory_parameter} but use the @code{-n} attribute when declaring the
variable.  This makes the new variable a NAMEREF for the given variable name; @bashref{Shell
Parameters, Shell Parameters}.

A use of this macro roughly expands into:

@example
local mbfl_a_variable_@var{NAME}=$@{@var{NUMBER}:?@}
local -n @var{NAME}=$mbfl_a_variable_@var{NAME}
@end example

@noindent
where the @emph{proxy variable} @var{NAME} is defined as an alias of the @emph{data variable}, whose
name is stored in the numeric parameter; the additional @emph{name variable}
@code{mbfl_a_variable_@var{NAME}} holds the name of the @emph{data variable}.  We can use the macro

@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} mbfl_mandatory_integer_parameter @var{varname} @var{number} @var{description}
Like @func{mbfl_mandatory_parameter} but use the @code{-i} attribute when declaring the variable.
This assigns the integer attribute to the variable; @bashref{Bash Builtins, Bash Builtins}.
@end deffn


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} mbfl_optional_parameter @var{varname} @var{number}
@deffnx {Preprocessor Macro} mbfl_optional_parameter @var{varname} @var{number} @var{default_value}
Define a variable local to a shell function holding an argument to the
function.

The argument @var{varname} is the name of the variable.  The argument @var{number} is the positional
parameter number.  The argument @var{default_value} is the initialisation value for the variable if
the argument is not used; when @var{default_value} is not present: the variable is left empty.

Example, the following:

@example
mbfl_optional_parameter(COUNT, 2, 123)
@end example

@noindent
is expanded to:

@smallexample
local COUNT=$@{2:-123@}"
@end smallexample

@noindent
and the following:

@example
mbfl_optional_parameter(COUNT, 2)
@end example

@noindent
is expanded to:

@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} mbfl_command_line_argument @var{varname} @var{argindex}
Define a variable local to a shell function holding an argument to the script.  @var{varname} is the
variable name, @var{argindex} is the argument index in the @code{ARGV} array.

Example, the following:

@example
mbfl_command_line_argument(PATHNAME,3)

@section Variable name references


The preprocessor implements facilities to declare variables with unique names and use them as target
for variables with the NAMEREF attribute.  With these facilities we can use the @code{_var} variants
of @mbfl{} functions as follows:

@example
mbfl_local_varref(RV)

mbfl_file_extension_var mbfl_datavar(RV) /path/to/file.ext
"$RV"  @result{} ext
@end example

@noindent
without risking a variable name collision.  In this example, the use of @func{mbfl_local_varref}
expands into:

@example
local mbfl_a_variable_RV
mbfl_variable_alloc mbfl_a_variable_RV
local $mbfl_a_variable_RV
local -n RV=$mbfl_a_variable_RV
@end example

@noindent
a local @dfn{name variable} @code{mbfl_a_variable_RV} is declared and filled with a unique @dfn{data
variable} name by @func{mbfl_variable_alloc}; then the @dfn{data variable} is declared as local;
finally a @dfn{proxy variable} @code{RV} is defined as alias for the @dfn{data variable}.

Given a @dfn{proxy variable} name defined this way: we can retrieve its @dfn{name variable} name
with the macro @func{mbfl_namevar}; we can retrieve its @dfn{data variable} name with the macro
@func{mbfl_datavar}.

Other macros declare variables similarly, using the same scheme of 3 variable declarations: name
variable, data variable, proxy variable.

A local @dfn{name variable} @code{mbfl_a_variable_@var{NAME}} is declared and filled with a unique
@dfn{data variable} name by @func{mbfl_variable_alloc}; then the @dfn{data variable} is declared as
local; finally a @dfn{proxy variable} @code{NAME} is defined as alias for the @dfn{data variable}.

@end example

@noindent
and when @var{INIT_VALUE} is @strong{not} empty, it finishes with:

@chapter Required user defined variables


The following variables are expected to be defined before the @mbfl{}
code is evaluated.  They are used by @mbfl{} to compute values for its
own variables.


@defvar script_PROGNAME
The name of the script.  It is used, for example, in error and verbose
messages.
@end defvar


@defvar script_AUTHOR
The name of the script author(s).  It is used in copyright statements.
@end defvar


@defvar script_COPYRIGHT_YEARS
A comma separated list of years of copyright.  It is used in copyright
statements.
@end defvar


@defvar script_VERSION
The version number of the script.  It is used in copyright statements
and it can be directly queried using the command line options
@option{--version} and @option{--version-only}.
@end defvar


@defvar script_LICENSE
The identifier of the license under which the script is released.  Accepted values are: @code{GPL}
or @code{GPL2}, @code{GPL3}, @code{LGPL} or @code{LGPL2}, @code{LGPL3}, @code{BSD}, @code{liberal}.
It is used to select the appropriate value to be displayed when the user of the script selects the
@code{--license} option.  @ref{getopts options, Predefined options}
@end defvar

@defvar script_USAGE
Must be a string, of one or more lines, describing the synopsis of the
program.  It is usually something like:

@example
script_USAGE="usage: $@{script_PROGNAME@} [options] ..."
@end example

@noindent
if the script accepts either input from the stdin channel and input from
a selected file, it is useful to present both cases:

@example
script_USAGE="usage: $@{script_PROGNAME@} [options] <INPUT-FILE
usage: $@{script_PROGNAME@} [options] INPUT-FILE"
@end example

If the script defines multiple actions: it is better to define a
synopsis description for every supported action, by setting this
variable in the action--specific ``before parsing options'' function.
@ref{actions} for details.
@end defvar


@defvar script_DESCRIPTION
One line string providing a brief description of the program.  It is used
in the help screen (the one echoed when the @option{--help} option is
used) right after the content of @code{script_USAGE}.

If the script defines multiple actions: it is better to define a usage
description for every supported action, by setting this variable in the
action--specific ``before parsing options'' function.  @ref{actions} for
details.
@end defvar

@defvar script_EXAMPLES
One or more lines of text to be displayed at the end of the help screen,
after the options description.  It should contain examples of common
invocations for the script.

If the script defines multiple actions: it is better to define a set of
examples description for every supported action, by setting this
variable in the action--specific ``before parsing options'' function.
@ref{actions} for details.
@end defvar


All the text in these variables is used as argument to the @code{printf}
built--in command; in particular: @code{script_DESCRIPTION} and
@code{script_EXAMPLES} are used as first argument to @code{printf}, so
the escape sequences (in particular @code{\t} and @code{\n}) are
expanded.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Examples

The following example shows how to declare the variables.

@example
script_PROGNAME=myscript.sh
script_AUTHOR='Marco Maggi and Marco Maggi'
script_COPYRIGHT_YEARS='2002, 2003, 2004'
script_VERSION=1.0
script_LICENSE=GPL3
script_USAGE="usage: $script_PROGNAME [options] ..."
script_DESCRIPTION='Does this and that.'
script_EXAMPLES='Examples:

\tmyscript.sh --do-something arg arg ...
\tmyscript.sh --do-other arg arg ...'
@end example

Notice that @code{script_DESCRIPTION} and @code{script_EXAMPLES}
@strong{do not} end with a newline character.

@chapter Encoding and decoding strings


The purpose of this module is to let an external process invoke a Bash script with @emph{damned}
command line arguments: strings including blanks or strange characters that may trigger quoting
rules.  This problem can arise when using scripting languages with some sort of @code{eval} command.

The solution is to encode the argument string in hexadecimal or octal format strings, so that all
the damned characters are converted to ``good'' ones.  The Bash script can convert them back.

@quotation
@strong{NOTE} Internally Bash represents strings as C language style @asciiz{} arrays, so it is
impossible to correctly handle null bytes in a Bash variable: the string will get truncated at the
null byte.
@end quotation

The following functions perform actions that can normally be done
directly with the redirection operators of Bash:

@example
# write to a file
printf '%s' "$string" >"$filename"

# append to a file
printf '%s' "$string" >>"$filename"

# read a file, print contents
printf '%s' "$(<$filename)"
@end example

The functions act differently in that they spawn a @command{bash}
subprocess, by invoking @func{mbfl_program_exec}, and let it do the
operation; this allows us to request the usage of @command{sudo} and so
to read and write files with modified privileges, but only for the time
needed to do the operation, not for the whole script.


@defun mbfl_file_write @var{string} @var{filename}
Write @var{string} to @var{filename}, eventually creating it or
overwriting old contents.

@defun mbfl_file_append @var{string} @var{filename}
Append @var{string} to @var{filename}, eventually creating it.

Open the file descriptor @var{FD} to read from @var{FILE}.  When successful: return true; otherwise

Let's see how we can open a file for reading and writing with two file descriptors:

@example
declare TESTFILE=/path/to/file.ext
declare INFD=3 OUFD=4
declare LINE

mbfl_fd_open_output $OUFD "$TESTFILE"

read -u $@{INFD@} LINE
mbfl_fd_close $INFD

echo "$LINE"

@noindent
now let's use a location to automatically close the file descriptors:

@example
declare TESTFILE=/path/to/file.ext
declare INFD=3 OUFD=4
declare LINE

mbfl_location_enter
@{
    mbfl_fd_open_output $OUFD "$TESTFILE"

@node actions intro
@section Introduction to action trees


Traditional Unix--style command line programs perform a single action, with behaviour variants
selected by command line dash and double--dash options.  For example @command{ls} prints a list of
directory entries and the format of the output can be custommised with options like @option{-1} and
@option{--color}.  @mbfl{} implements this behaviour by default when the @code{actions} module is
@strong{not} used.

Other Unix--style command line programs offer a set of possible actions and allow the executor to
select one by specifying command line options.  For example @command{tar} acts on archive files and
it can pack, unpack, validate them along with other actions selected with by the double--dash
options @option{--create}, @option{--extract}, @option{--validate} and others.  @mbfl{} implements
this behaviour through ``action options'' provided by the @code{getopts} module; action options are
available also when using the @code{actions} module.

Other command line programs break this Unix--style to offer action selection throuh ``action
arguments''.  For example @command{git} acts upon revision control repositories offering a big set
of actions selected with its first argument: @samp{commit}, @samp{log}, @samp{merge} and many
others; the behaviour of each ``subcommand'' can be customised with a specific set of dash and
double--dash options.  @mbfl{} implements this behaviour through the @code{actions} module.

@section Declaring actions and action sets


The structure of the action sets tree is stored in global variables defined by default; we should
never try to access such variables directly.


@defun mbfl_declare_action_set @var{action-set}
Declare a new action set.  @var{action-set} must be a string satisfying @func{mbfl_string_is_name}
and representing the identifier of the action set.  It is an error to declare the same action set
twice.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_declare_action @var{action-set} @var{keyword} @var{subset} @var{identifier} @var{description}
Declare a new action belonging to an action set.  The arguments are:

@table @var
@item action-set
A string representing the name of the action set this action belongs to.  The action set must have
been previously declared with a call to @func{mbfl_declare_action_set}.

@item keyword
A unique string (in this script) satisfying @func{mbfl_string_is_name} and identifying this action.
The ``main'', ``before parsing options'' and ``after parsing options'' function names associated to
this action are built as:

@example
script_action_$@var{keyword}
script_before_parsing_options_$@var{keyword}
script_after_parsing_options_$@var{keyword}
@end example

@item subset
If @var{subset} is the string @code{NONE} it means that this action is a leaf and it implements a
script action; else @var{subset} must be the identifier of an action set subordinate to
@var{action-set}: this function is recursively called to process it.  The subordinate action set
must have been previously declared with a call to @func{mbfl_declare_action_set}.

@item identifier
A string satisfying @func{mbfl_string_is_identifier} and representing the argument on the command
line used to select this action.  This string must be unique for this @var{action-set}.

@item description
A string describing this action, to be used to compose the help screen.

mbfl_main_set_after_parsing_options
mbfl_main_set_main
@end example

@noindent
If successful return true, else return false and print an error message to @stderr{}.  This
function recursively calls itself, parsing command line arguments and traversing the tree of
declared actions.

@var{action-set} must be the name of an action set previously declared with
@func{mbfl_declare_action_set}.  It is an error if this function is called with an @var{action-set}
name specifying a non--existent action set.  If there are no command line arguments left upon
entering this function: the values previously selected are silently accepted.

The function @func{mbfl_main} verifies that the action set @code{MAIN} exists and, if it does, it
calls this function with argument @code{MAIN}.

Upon entering this function, the following global variables must exist and have the specified
values:

@table @code
@item ARGV1
An array containing all the command line arguments.

@item ARGC1
A non--negative integer representing the number of values in
@code{ARGV1}.

@item ARG1ST
A non--negative integer representing the index in @code{ARGV1} of the next argument to be processed.

@table @code
@item -a
Brief option @code{a} with no value.

@item -a123
Brief option @code{a} with value @code{123}.

@item --bianco
Long option @code{bianco} with no value.

* getopts interface::           Interface functions.
@end menu

@c page
@node getopts arguments
@section Arguments


The @code{main} module contains, at the root level, a block of code like
the following:

@example
declare -i ARGC=0 ARGC1=0 ARG1ST=0
declare -a ARGV ARGV1

for ((ARGC1=0; $# > 0; ++ARGC1))
do
    ARGV1[$ARGC1]=$1
    shift
done
@end example

@noindent
this block is executed when @mbfl{} (and the script that loads it) is
evaluated.  Its purpose is to store command line arguments in the global
array @code{ARGV1} and the number of command line arguments in the
global variable @code{ARGC1}; the variable @code{ARG1ST} references the
next argument in @code{ARGV1} that must be processed.

The global array @code{ARGV} and the global variable @code{ARGC} are
predefined and should be used by the @code{mbfl_getopts_*} functions to
store non--option command line arguments.  Processing performed by the
@code{getopts} module must happen after processing performed by the
@code{actions} module.

Example:

@example
$ script --gulp wo --gasp=123 wa
@end example

@noindent
if the script makes use of @mbfl{}, the strings @code{wo} and @code{wa}
will go into @code{ARGV} and @code{ARGC} will be set to 2.  The option
arguments are processed and some action is performed to register them.

We can access the non--option arguments with the following code:

@example
for ((i=0; $i < $ARGC; ++i))
do
    # do something with $@{ARGV[$i]@}
done
@end example

When using the @code{actions} module: the first arguments can be
interpreted as special values that select an action to be performed by
the script; in such case the first argument is removed from the
@code{ARGV} array, so that processing the other arguments is not
affected.  @ref{actions intro, Introduction to action trees}.

@c page
@node getopts usage
@section Using the module


To use this module we have to declare a set of script options with the
function @func{mbfl_declare_option}.  Options declarations should be
done at the beginning of the script, before doing anything else, or in
the ``before parsing options'' functions.

In the main block of the script, options are parsed by invoking
@func{mbfl_getopts_parse}: this function will update global variables
and invoke a script function for each option on the command line.  It
can also select a function to be invoked as the main action of the
script.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Option with no argument

Example of option declaration:

@example
mbfl_declare_option ALPHA no a alpha noarg "enable alpha option"
@end example

@noindent
this code declares an option with no argument having properties:

@itemize
@item
Global variable @code{script_option_ALPHA}, which will be set to
@code{no} by default and to @code{yes} if the option is used.

@item
Brief switch @option{-a}.

@item
Long switch @option{--alpha}.

@item
Description @code{enable alpha option}, to be shown in the usage help
screen.
@end itemize

If the option is used: the function @code{script_option_update_alpha} is invoked (if it exists) with
no arguments, after the variable @code{script_option_ALPHA} has been set to @code{yes}; in the
function name: @code{alpha} is the lower case variant of the keyword @code{ALPHA}.  Valid option
uses are:

@example
$ script.sh -a
$ script.sh --alpha
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Option with argument

Example of option declaration:

@example
mbfl_declare_option BETA 123 b beta witharg "select beta value"
@end example

@noindent
this code declares an option with argument having properties:

@itemize
@item
Global variable @code{script_option_BETA}, which will be set to
@code{123} by default and to the value selected on the command line if
the option is used.

@item
Brief switch @option{-b}.

@item
Long switch @option{--beta}.

@item
Description @code{select beta value}, to be shown in the usage output.
@end itemize

If the option is used: the function @code{script_option_update_beta} is invoked (if it exists) with
no arguments, after the variable @code{script_option_BETA} has been set to the selected value; in
the function name: @code{beta} is the lower case variant of the keyword @code{BETA}.  Valid option
uses are:

@example
$ script.sh -b456
$ script.sh --beta=456
@end example

@noindent
it is an error to use the switch @option{-b} or  @option{--beta} with
no argument (that is: with an empty string as argument).

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Action options

A special option example:

@example
mbfl_declare_option ACTION_GAMMA \
   no g gamma noarg "do gamma action"
mbfl_declare_option ACTION_DELTA \
   yes d delta noarg "do delta action"
@end example

@noindent
this code declares two options with no arguments; the difference from
the other declarations is that the keywords are prefixed with
@code{ACTION_}: this prefix is recognised by the module and causes, if
the option is used on the command line, the following code to be
evaluated at arguments parsing time:

@example
mbfl_main_set_main script_action_gamma
@end example

@noindent
or:

@example
mbfl_main_set_main script_action_delta
@end example

@noindent
where the argument @code{script_action_gamma} is built by prefixing the
lower case version of the keyword with @code{script_}.  The code selects
a function as main function for the script.  @ref{main function, Driving
script execution}.

Additionally, if the default value is @code{yes}: the main function is
selected at declaration time (that is by @func{mbfl_declare_option});
this is useful to declare an action option and select automatically the
action function.  In the example: the function
@func{script_action_delta} is selected as main action function.

It is an error to declare a keyword prefixed with @code{ACTION_} with an
option with argument (@code{witharg} as argument to
@func{mbfl_declare_option}).

@section Predefined options


A set of predefined options is recognised by the library and not handed
to the user defined functions.

@table @option
@item --tmpdir=DIR
@cindex @option{--tmpdir}, predefined option
@cindex Predefined option @option{--tmpdir}
Selects a directory for temporary files.  The default value is the one in
the environment variable @env{TMPDIR}, or @file{/tmp/$USER} if that
variable is not set.  The value is stored in the variable
@code{mbfl_option_TMPDIR}.

@item --encoded-args
@cindex @option{--encoded-args}, predefined option
@cindex Predefined option @option{--encoded-args}
Signals to the library that the non--option arguments and the option
values are encoded in hexadecimal strings.  Encoding is useful to avoid
quoting problems when invoking a script from another one.

If this option is used: the values are decoded by
@func{mbfl_getopts_parse} before storing them in the @code{ARGV}
array and before being stored in the option's specific global variables.

@itemx --verbose
@cindex @option{-v}, predefined option
@cindex Predefined option @option{-v}
@cindex @option{--verbose}, predefined option
@cindex Predefined option @option{--verbose}

before doing dangerous operations, like overwriting files.  The global
variable @code{mbfl_option_INTERACTIVE} is set to @code{yes}.

@item --validate-programs
@cindex @option{--validate-programs}, predefined option
@cindex Predefined option @option{--validate-programs}
Validates the existence of all the programs needed by the script; then
exits.  The exit code is zero if all the programs were found, one
otherwise.

Every declared option should have a long switch, the brief switch can be
omitted.


@defun mbfl_declare_option @var{keyword} @var{default} @var{brief} @var{long} @var{hasarg} @var{description}
Declare a new option.  Arguments description follows.

@table @var
@item keyword
A string identifying the option; internally it is used to build a
function name and a variable name.  It is safer to limit this string to
the letters in the ranges @code{a-z}, @code{A-Z} and underscores.

@item default
The default value for the option.  For an option with argument it can be
anything; for an option with no argument: it must be @code{yes} or
@code{no}.

@item brief
The brief option selector: a single character.  It is safer to choose a
single letter (lower or upper case) in the @acronym{ASCII} standard.

@item long
The long option selector: a string.  It is safer to choose a sequence of
letters in the @acronym{ASCII} standard, separated by underscores or
dashes.

@item hasarg
Either @code{witharg} or @code{noarg}: declares if the option requires
an argument or not.

@item description
A one--line string briefly describing the option.

@section Testing a script and running programs


@mbfl{} allows a script to execute a ``dry run'', that is: do not
perform any operation on the system, just print messages describing what
will happen if the script is executed with the selected options.  This
implies, in the @mbfl{} model, that no external program is executed.

When this feature is turned on: @func{mbfl_program_exec} does not
execute the program, instead it prints the command line on standard
error and it returns true.


@defun mbfl_set_option_test
Enable the script test option.  After this: a script must not mutate the
system in any way, it should just print messages describing the
operations.

However, the script is allowed to acquire informations from the system;
for example it can acquire the list of files in a directory or load the
contents of a file.

This function is invoked when the predefined option @option{--test} is
used on the command line.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_unset_option_test
Disable the script test option.  After this a script must perform normal
operations.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_option_test
Return true if test execution is enabled, else return false.
@end defun


@c page
@node program checking
@section Checking programs existence


The simpler way to test the availability of a program is to look for it just before it is used.


@defvr Array mbfl_split_PATH
After a call to @func{mbfl_program_split_path}: this array is filled with the components of the
@env{PATH} variable.
@end defvr


@defun mbfl_program_split_path
If the number of pairs in the global array @code{mbfl_split_PATH} is zero: split the current value
of @var{PATH} into its components by splitting the string using the colon character @code{:} as
separator; store the result in the global array @code{mbfl_split_PATH}; finally return true.

If the number of pairs in the global array @code{mbfl_split_PATH} is not zero: do nothing and return
false.

We can print the contents of the array with:

@example

@defun mbfl_program_find @var{program}
@defunx mbfl_program_find_var @var{_RV} @var{program}
Search for a program in the standard search path.  Print the full pathname of the program found, or
an empty string if nothing is found.  If an executable file is found: return true; otherwise return
false.

The search path is the one in the environment variable @var{ENV} as found by
@func{mbfl_program_split_path}.  The contained directories are searched in the order in which they
appear in @env{PATH}.  There are rules:

@itemize
@item
If @var{program} is an absolute pathname (according to @func{mbfl_file_is_absolute}): only that
absolute pathname is verified as executable file.  @var{PATH} is ignored.

@item
If @var{program} is a relative pathname with at least one slash character in it: only that relative
pathname is verified as executable file.  @var{PATH} is ignored.

@item
If @var{program} is a relative pathname without slash characters in it: the standard search path is
used.
@end itemize

The @code{_var} function variant will store the result in the variable @var{_RV} rather than print
it.

@section Executing a program


This module provides an @api{} to execute a program under the privileges
of the current user or under a more or less privileged user;
@command{sudo} is used run a program as a different user: refer to its
documentation for the required configuration; @command{whoami} is used
to determine to which user the process belongs.

At package configuration time we can specify which @command{sudo} and
@command{whoami} executables to use through the following options for
the configuration script @command{configure}:

@table @code
@item --with-sudo=/path/to/sudo
Allows the selection of the pathname to the executable @command{sudo};
this pathname is hard--coded in the library.  It defaults to:
@file{/usr/bin/sudo}.

@item --with-whoami=/path/to/whoami
Allows the selection of the pathname to the executable @command{whoami};
this pathname is hard--coded in the library.  It defaults to:
@file{/usr/bin/whoami}.
@end table

The functions described here must be used in the following way:

@itemize
@item
To execute a program under the current user privileges:

@example
mbfl_program_exec ls /bin
@end example

@item
To execute a program under a more or less privileged user:

@example
# At the beginning of the script:
mbfl_program_enable_sudo

# When executing a program:
mbfl_program_declare_sudo_user root
mbfl_program_exec ls /root
@end example
@end itemize

Every time we execute a program with @command{sudo}: we have to select
the user under which to execute it; if we do not do it: the internally
registered user defaults to @code{nosudo}, which tells the function
@strong{not} to use @command{sudo}.  So the following script works as
commented:

@example
mbfl_program_enable_sudo

# This is executed with the privileges of the user that
# launched the script.
mbfl_program_exec ls /bin

mbfl_program_declare_sudo_user root
# This is executed with root privileges.
mbfl_program_exec ls /root

# This is executed with the privileges of the user that
# launched the script.
mbfl_program_exec ls /bin
@end example


@defun mbfl_program_exec @var{program}
@defunx mbfl_program_exec @var{program} @var{arg} ...
Evaluate a command line.  @var{program} identifies an executable file:
it can be the program name, or a relative or absolute pathname.  The
optional @var{arg} values are command line arguments that are handed to
the program unchanged.

If usage of @command{sudo} was requested, the command is executed with
it; then the @command{sudo} request is reset.  This means that this
function ``consumes'' a @command{sudo} request.

See below for the redirection of the standard error channel.

If the function @func{mbfl_option_test} returns true: instead of
evaluation, the command line is sent to stderr.

If the function @func{mbfl_option_show_program} returns true: the
command line is sent to stderr, then it is executed.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_execbg @var{inchan} @var{ouchan} @var{program}
@defunx mbfl_program_execbg @var{inchan} @var{ouchan} @var{program} @var{arg} ...
Does all the same things of @func{mbfl_program_exec}, running the given
command line as:

@example
@var{program} @var{arg} ... <&@var{inchan} >&@var{ouchan} &
@end example

@noindent
additionally: set the global variable @code{mbfl_program_BGPID} to the
process ID of the background process; that is: @code{mbfl_program_BGPID}
is the value of @code{$!} right after the process execution.

Using this function is different from calling:

@example
mbfl_program_exec ls <&@var{inchan} >&@var{ouchan} &
@end example

@noindent
because doing so puts in the background the function call (in a subshell)
and then runs the program.

Notice that we @strong{must} always use numeric file descriptors as @var{inchan} and @var{ouchan}
arguments.  Also we can always use the default file descriptors, for example:

@example
mbfl_program_execbg 0 1 /bin/ls
@end example

The readable aliases @file{/dev/stdin}, @file{/dev/stdout}, @file{/dev/fd/0}, @file{/dev/fd/1} are
@strong{not} usable as @var{inchan} and @var{ouchan} arguments (remember that the aliases are
@strong{not} available, for example, when the script is run from a cron job).
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_replace @var{program}
@defunx mbfl_program_replace @var{program} [@var{opt} @dots{}]
Like @func{mbfl_program_exec}, but execute the program through the Bash
command @code{exec}, so replacing the current process without creating a
new one.
@end defun


@defvar mbfl_program_BGPID
Used by @func{mbfl_program_execbg} to store the process id of the
program executed in background.
@end defvar


@defun mbfl_program_enable_sudo
Declare the intention to use @command{sudo} and other commands required
to use it.  The declared programs are: @command{sudo}, @command{whoami}.

This function does @strong{not} use @func{mbfl_declare_program}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_declare_sudo_user @var{user}
Register @var{user} as the user under which to execute the next program through @command{sudo}; the
user will be selected using the @code{-u} option of @command{sudo}.  The value @code{nosudo} means:
do not use @command{sudo}.

The string @var{user} must satisfy the function @func{mbfl_string_is_username}, else the function
will print an error message to @stderr{} and exit with @func{exit_because_invalid_sudo_username}.

When the time comes: if the selected user name equals the value printed by @command{whoami},
@command{sudo} is not used.
@end defun


@defun exit_because_invalid_sudo_username
@defunx return_because_invalid_sudo_username
Exit or return with code @code{90}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_reset_sudo_user

cause @command{sudo} not to be used in the next program invocation.
This is useful to abort a user request.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_sudo_user
Print the current @command{sudo} user.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_requested_sudo
Return true if the usage of @command{sudo} has been requested for the

@subsubheading Redirecting the standard error channel

There are programs that output useful informations on their stderr

Just for the next invocation to @func{mbfl_program_exec} redirect
stderr to stdout, that is: use the @code{2>&1} redirection for the
executed program.
@end defun


This is useful because redirecting the output of
@func{mbfl_program_exec}:

@example
echo ls | \
    mbfl_program_exec at 'now +25 minutes' 2>&1 | \
    while read
@end example

@noindent
redirects also the ``show program'' output (@ref{getopts options} for
the @option{--show-program} option explanation and see the above
description of @func{mbfl_program_exec}).  Instead By using:

@example
mbfl_program_redirect_stderr_to_stdout
echo ls | \
    mbfl_program_exec at 'now +25 minutes' | \
    while read
@end example

@noindent
the ``show program'' output goes to stderr and the stderr output of the
@command{at} command is, internally, redirected to the stdout of
@func{mbfl_program_exec}.

@c page
@node program declaring
@section Declaring the intention to use a program


To make a script model simpler, we assume that the unavailability of a
program at the time of its execution is a fatal error.  So if we need to
execute a program and the executable is not there, the script must be
aborted on the spot.

Functions are provided to test the availability of a program, so we can
try to locate an alternative or terminate the process under the script
control.  On a system where executables may vanish from one moment to
another, no matter how we test a program's existence, there's always the
possibility that the program is not ``there'' when we invoke it.

If we just use @func{mbfl_program_exec} to invoke an external
program, the function will try and fail if the executable is
unavailable: the return code will be false.

The vanishing of a program is a rare event: if it's there when we look
for it, probably it will be there also a few moments later when we
invoke it.  For this reason, @mbfl{} proposes a set of functions with
which we can declare the intention of a script to use a set of programs.

A command line option is predefined to let the user test the
availability of all the declared programs before invoking the script.
@ref{getopts options, Predefined options}.


@defun mbfl_declare_program @var{program}
Register @var{program} as the name of a program required by the script;
@func{mbfl_program_find} is used to locate the program on the system.
@ref{program checking, Checking programs existence}.

If @var{program} is a file name with no directory part (examples:
@command{sed}, @command{grep}) the selected program is the full pathname
of the file in one of the directories of @env{PATH}.

If @var{program} is a relative pathname (examples: @file{../bin/sed},
@file{./grep}): the selected program is the full pathname of the file
normalised by this function with respect to the current working
directory (with a call to @func{mbfl_file_normalise}).

The return value is always zero.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_validate_declared
Validate the existence of all the declared programs.  The return value
is zero if all the programs are found, one otherwise.

This function is invoked by @func{mbfl_getopts_parse} when the
@option{--validate-programs} option is used on the command line.

It may be a good idea to invoke this function at the beginning of a
script, just before starting to do stuff, example:

@example
mbfl_program_validate_declared || \
   exit_because_program_not_found
@end example

If verbose messages are enabled: a brief summary is echoed to stderr;
from the command line the option @option{--verbose} must be used before
@option{--validate-programs}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_found @var{program}
@defunx mbfl_program_found_var @var{_RV} @var{program}
Print the pathname of the previously declared @var{program}.  Return zero if the program was found,
otherwise print an error message and exit the current (sub)shell by invoking
@func{exit_because_program_not_found}.

This function should be used to retrieve the pathname of the program to be used as first argument to
@func{mbfl_program_exec}:

The function variant @code{_var} will store the result in @var{_RV} rather than printing it.

@example
function program_wrapper () @{
    mbfl_mandatory_parameter(ARGUMENT, 1, argument)
    shift
    local PROGNAME FLAGS

    mbfl_program_found_var PROGNAME myprog || exit $?

    mbfl_option_verbose_program && FLAGS+=' --verbose'
    mbfl_program_exec "$PROGNAME" $FLAGS "$ARGUMENT" "$@@"
@}
@end example

Remember that we cannot use:

@example
local PROGNAME=$(mbfl_program_found 'myprog') || exit $?
@end example

@noindent
because @code{local} has exit status zero even if @func{mbfl_program_found} fails, so the error
will not be reported.
@end defun


@defun exit_because_program_not_found
@defunx return_because_program_not_found
Exit or return with code @code{99}.

@section Scheduling jobs for later execution


This section documents the interface to the @command{atd} daemon; we may want to read the
@command{at}(1) manual page.  The @command{at} service allows a user to schedule commands to be
executed at a later time.

This interface is suitable for scripts that define a unique simple policy to schedule commands;
example: at each run they schedule a command in a fixed queue, to be executed at a fixed time in the
future.

This is good to implement the logic: if a condition does not happen before time @code{T}, then
execute command @command{C}.

@defun mbfl_at_validate_selected_queue
Return true if the currently selected queue identifier is valid, else print an error message and
return false.  A false return code means that an internal error has corrupted the module's state.
@end defun

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Commands scheduling


@defun mbfl_at_select_queue @var{letter}
Select and register in an internal state a queue identifier; invoke
@func{mbfl_at_validate_queue_letter} to validate the selection.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_at_schedule @var{command} @var{time}
Schedule @var{command} in the currently selected queue; the script will be executed at @var{time}.

If no error occurs: print to stdout the identifier of the scheduled job; the identifier can be used
as argument to @func{mbfl_at_drop}.

@quotation
The @command{at} command outputs some text (in which the job is embedded) on its @stderr{}
channel, so this function redirects @stderr{} to @stdout{} to return the value; this
operation conflicts with the use of the ``show program'' feature of @func{mbfl_program_exec}.
@end quotation

@var{command} must be a string representing the invocation of an external executable program: it is
sent unchanged to the @command{at} command.  @var{time} is the argument to the @command{at} command,
see the manual page for its description.

Split a string into characters.  Fill an array named @code{SPLITFIELD} with the characters from the
string; the number of elements in the array is stored in a variable named @code{SPLITCOUNT}.  Both
@code{SPLITFIELD} and @code{SPLITCOUNT} can be declared @code{local} in the scope of the caller.

The difference between this function and using @code{$@{STRING:$i:1@}}, is that this function
detects backslash characters, @code{\}, and treats them as part of the following character.  So, for
example, the sequence @code{\n} is treated as a single char.
@end defun


Example of usage for @func{mbfl_string_chars}:

@example
local SPLITFIELD
local -i SPLITCOUNT

string="abcde\nfghilm"
mbfl_string_chars "$@{string@}"

$SPLITCOUNT             @result{} 12
"$@{SPLITFIELD[0]@}"    @result{} a
"$@{SPLITFIELD[1]@}"    @result{} b
"$@{SPLITFIELD[2]@}"    @result{} c
"$@{SPLITFIELD[3]@}"    @result{} d
"$@{SPLITFIELD[4]@}"    @result{} e
"$@{SPLITFIELD[5]@}"    @result{} \n
"$@{SPLITFIELD[6]@}"    @result{} f
"$@{SPLITFIELD[7]@}"    @result{} g
"$@{SPLITFIELD[8]@}"    @result{} h
"$@{SPLITFIELD[9]@}"    @result{} i
"$@{SPLITFIELD[10]@}"   @result{} l
"$@{SPLITFIELD[11]@}"   @result{} m
@end example


@defun mbfl_string_split @var{string} @var{separator}
Split @var{string} into fields using @var{separator}.  Fill an array named @code{SPLITFIELD} with
the characters from the string; the number of elements in the array is stored in a variable named
@code{SPLITCOUNT}.  We can declare both @code{SPLITFIELD} and @code{SPLITCOUNT} as @code{local} in
the scope of the caller.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_string_split_blanks @var{string}
Split @var{string} into fields using adjacent blank characters as separators.  Fill an array named
@code{SPLITFIELD} with the characters from the string; the number of elements in the array is stored
in a variable named @code{SPLITCOUNT}.  We can declare both @code{SPLITFIELD} and @code{SPLITCOUNT}
as @code{local} in the scope of the caller.

@example
local -a SPLITFIELD
local -i SPLITCOUNT
local STRING

printf -v STRING 'abc\t \tdef\t\t ghi \t\tlmn\t \topq\t\t   rs'

mbfl_string_split_blanks "$STRING"

$SPLITCOUNT             @result{} 6

effect of filling the variable in that scope.

@strong{NOTE} We should use the built--in @code{printf -v @var{varname}} construct, rather than this
function.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_string_skip @var{string} @var{varname} @var{char}
Skip all the characters in a string equal to @var{char}.  @var{varname} is the name of a variable in
the scope of the caller: Its value is the offset of the first character to test in @var{string}.
The offset is incremented until a char different from @var{char} is found, then the value of
@var{varname} is updated to the position of the different char.  If the initial value of the offset
corresponds to a char equal to @var{char}, the variable is left untouched.  Return true.

@example
local -i i

# The char "z" is not present in the string: leave "i" untouched.
i=3
;;               0123456
mbfl_string_skip abcdefg i z
$i @result{} 3

# The whole string  is filled with "a": increment "i" to
# the length of the string itself.
i=3
;;               0123456
mbfl_string_skip aaaaaaa i a
$i @result{} 7

# Skip until the index of the "d" character.
i=3

mbfl_string_skip abcccccdefg i c
$i @result{} 7

@defun mbfl_string_strip_carriage_return_var @var{_RV} @var{LINE}
When exchanging strings with a remote process through a network socket we, usually, need to end a
line with a carriage return plus line feed sequence.  If we use the command @command{read} to read a
line from a socket: we can instruct it to discard the ending line feed, yielding us a line ending
with a carriage return.

This function strips the ending carriage return from @var{LINE}, if any, and stores the result in
the result variable @var{_RV}.  It is fine if @var{LINE} is the empty string.

Register the value of the variable @code{script_PROGNAME} in the message module using the function
@func{mbfl_message_set_progname}.

@item
Invoke @func{mbfl_main_create_exit_functions}.  @ref{main exit, Declaring exit codes}.

@item
Parse the command line arguments according to the command actions configuration; this step may
change the selection of: main function, ``before parsing options'' function, ``after parsing
options'' function; if no command actions are configured: nothing is done.

This function searches for a declared action set with name @code{MAIN}: if such set exists, it
expects the first command line argument to be an action identifier in the set.

@item
If it exists: invoke the function @func{script_before_parsing_options} or the one selected by

@end defun

@c page
@node main exit
@section Declaring exit codes


Some functions and global variables are provided to declare script's exit codes.  The @mbfl{}
declares its own exit codes starting from @code{100} and decreasing; we should declare our exit
codes starting from @code{3} and increasing.  The exit codes @code{0} and @code{1} are reserved for
the functions @func{exit_because_success} and @func{exit_because_failure}.


@defun mbfl_exit
Wrapper for the @command{exit} command that updates the internal state.
@end defun


@defvar mbfl_main_pending_EXIT_CODE
Set by @func{mbfl_exit} to the exit code this script is using.  This variable might be accessed by
atexit commands to appropriately react to an error condition.
@end defvar


@defun mbfl_main_is_exiting
Return true if the script is exiting.  This function might be called by a location command being run
by an atexit command.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_main_declare_exit_code @var{code} @var{name}
Declare an exit code with value @var{code} and identifier @var{name}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_main_create_exit_functions
For each of the codes declared with @func{mbfl_main_declare_exit_code}: create a function for the
@code{exit} command using the numerical code; create an alias for the @code{return} command using
the numerical code.  For example, if a code is declared as:

@example
mbfl_main_declare_exit_code 4 unexistent_file
@end example

@noindent
a function is created with:

@example
function exit_because_unexistent_file () @{ mbfl_exit 4; @}
@end example

@noindent
and an alias is created with:

@example
alias return_because_unexistent_file='return 4'
@end example

@noindent
the name of the function is the string @code{exit_because_} followed by the exit code name; the name
of the alias is the string @code{return_because_} followed by the exit code name.  The function may
be used in the script to exit the process.
@end defun


By default the exit code @code{0} is associated to the name @code{success} and the exit code
@code{1} is associated to the name @code{failure}; so the following functions exist.


@defun exit_because_success
@defunx exit_success
Exit the script with code @code{0}.
@end defun


@defun return_because_success
@defunx return_success
Return with code @code{0}.
@end defun


@defun exit_because_failure
@defunx exit_failure
Exit the script with code @code{1}.
@end defun


@defun return_because_failure
@defunx return_failure
Return with code @code{1}.
@end defun


@defun exit_because_error_loading_library
Exit the script with code @code{100}.
@end defun


@defun return_because_error_loading_library
Return with code @code{100}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_main_print_exit_code @var{name}
Print the code associated to @var{name}.
@end defun

@c page
@node main misc
@section Other functions


@defun mbfl_invoke_script_function @var{funcname}
If @var{funcname} is the name of an existing function: it is invoked with no arguments; the return
value is the one of the called function.  The existence test is performed with:

@example
type -t @var{FUNCNAME} = function
@end example

If the function does not exist: return by calling @code{return_because_invalid_function_name}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_invoke_existent_script_function @var{funcname}
Like @func{mbfl_invoke_script_function}, but if the function does not exist: print an error message
to @stderr{} and exit by calling @func{exit_because_invalid_function_name}.

@chapter Building test suites


@mbfl{} comes with a little library of functions that may be used to
build test suites; its aim is at building tests for Bash functions,
commands and scripts.

The ideas at the base of this library are taken from the @code{tcltest}
package distributed with the @acronym{TCL} core @footnote{@acronym{TCL}
stands for @emph{Tool Command Language} and it is a scripting language
originally written by John Ousterhout, see: @url{http://www.tcl.tk/}.};
this package had contributions from the following people/entities: Sun
Microsystems, Inc.; Scriptics Corporation; Ajuba Solutions; Don Porter,
@acronym{NIST}; probably many many others.

The library tries to do as much as possible using functions and aliases,
not variables; this is an attempt to let the user redefine functions to
his taste.

@node testing intro
@section A way to organise a test suite


A useful way to organise a test suite is to split it into a set of
files: one for each module to be tested.

The file @file{libmbfltest.sh} must be sourced at the beginning of each
test file.  This means that the variables that you set may interfere
with the ones in the library; this should not happen because the test
library prefixes variable names with @code{mbfl_} or @code{dotest_}, but
one exception is @env{TMPDIR}: do not set it in your script, use
@func{dotest-echo-tmpdir} to access that value.  @ref{testing files,
Handling files in tests}.


@subsubheading A not so automated example

To understand how the library works lets examine a bare bones example.

The function @code{dotest} should be invoked at the end of each module
in the test suite; each module should define functions starting with the
same prefix.  A module should be stored in a file, and should look like
the following:

@example
# mymodule.test --

source libmbfltest.sh
source module.sh

function module-featureA-1.1 () @{ ... @}
function module-featureA-1.2 () @{ ... @}
function module-featureA-2.1 () @{ ... @}
function module-featureB-1.1 () @{ ... @}
function module-featureB-1.2 () @{ ... @}

dotest module-
dotest-final-report

### end of file
@end example

@noindent
the file should be executed with:

@example
$ bash mymodule.test
@end example

To test just "feature A":

@example
$ TESTMATCH=module-featureA bash mymodule.test
@end example

Remember that the @code{source} builtin will look for files in the
directories selected by the @env{PATH} environment variables, so we may
want to do:

@example
$ PATH=path/to/modules:$@{PATH@} \
TESTMATCH=module-featureA bash mymodule.test
@end example

It is better to put such stuff in a @file{Makefile}, with @gnu{} Make:

@example
srcdir        = ...
builddir      = ...
BASH_PROGRAM  = bash
MODULES       = moduleA moduleB

testdir       = $(srcdir)/tests
test_FILES    = $(foreach f,$(MODULES),$(testdir)/$(f).test)

test_ENV      = PATH=$(builddir):$(testdir):$(PATH) \
                TESTMATCH=$(TESTMATCH)
test_CMD      = $(test_ENV) $(BASH_PROGRAM)

.PHONY: test-modules

test-modules:
        @@$(foreach f,$(test_FILES),$(test_CMD) $(f);)
@end example

@c page
@node testing shell
@section A script to run tests


@mbfl{} comes with a script that can be used to handle the execution
of tests; it is called @command{mbfltest.sh}.  Synopsis:

@example
mbfltest.sh [options] TESTFILE ...
@end example

@noindent
supported options are all the @mbfl{} generic ones (@ref{getopts
options, Predefined options}) and additionally:

@table @code
@item --start
Print start messages for tests, it is the same as invoking
@func{dotest-set-report-start}.

@item --end
Print end messages for tests, it is the same as invoking
@func{dotest-set-report-success}.

@item --match=VALUE
Select match pattern for tests, it is the same as setting the
@env{TESTMATCH} variable.

@item --directory=VALUE
Change directory before executing tests, but after having located the
test files on the file system.

@item --library=VALUE
Select a specific version of the @mbfl{} library.
@end table

When running tests with the script: in the test modules we can omit the
sourcing of @mbfl{} and the @mbfl{} test library, @command{mbfltest.sh}
does this before sourcing the test module.  Each test module is evaluated
in a @bash{} subprocess, so: there is no interference between modules;
each module has to do its own initialisation and finalisation.

With @gnu{} Make we can do:

@example
MBFLTEST        = mbfltest.sh
MBFLTEST_FLAGS  = --end
ifneq (,$(TESTMATCH))
MBFLTEST_FLAGS  += --match=$(TESTMATCH)
endif

srcdir          = ...
testdir         = $(srcdir)/tests
TESTNAME        = *
TESTFILES       = $(wildcard $(testdir)/$(TESTNAME).test)

.PHONY: test tests

ifneq ($(strip $(TESTFILES)),)
test tests:
        $(MBFLTEST) $(MBFLTEST_FLAGS) $(TESTFILES)
endif
@end example

@section Configuring the package


@defun dotest-set-verbose
@defunx dotest-unset-verbose
Set or unset verbose execution.  If verbose mode is on: some commands
output messages on stderr describing what is going on.  Examples: files
and directories creation/removal.
@end defun


@defun dotest-option-verbose
Return true if verbose mode is on, false otherwise.
@end defun


@defun dotest-set-test
@defunx dotest-unset-test
Set or unset test execution.  If test mode is on: external commands (like
@command{rm} and @command{mkdir}) are not executed, the command line is
sent to stderr.  Test mode is meant to be used to debug the test library
functions.
@end defun


@defun dotest-option-test
Return true if test mode is on, false otherwise.
@end defun


@defun dotest-set-debug
@defunx dotest-unset-debug
Enable or disable printing debug messages.  If debug mode is on: the function @func{dotest-debug}
will print its message; otherwise it will print nothing.
@end defun


@defun dotest-option-debug
Return true if debug mode is on, false otherwise.
@end defun


@defun dotest-set-report-start
@defunx dotest-unset-report-start
Set or unset printing a message upon starting a function.
@end defun


@defun dotest-option-report-start
Return true if start function reporting is on; otherwise return false.
@end defun


@defun dotest-set-report-success
@defunx dotest-unset-report-success
Set or unset printing a message when a function execution
succeeds.  Failed tests always cause a message to be printed.
@end defun


@defun dotest-option-report-success
Return true if success function reporting is on; otherwise return
false.
@end defun

@c page
@node testing running
@section Running test functions


@defun dotest-final-report
This function must be invoked as last command in the test file to report
errors and correctly exit the test script (in a way compatible with the
requirements of @gnu{} Automake).
@end defun


@defun dotest @var{pattern}
Run all the functions matching @var{pattern}.  Usually @var{pattern} is
the first part of the name of the functions to be executed; the function
names are selected with the following code:

@example
compgen -A function @var{pattern}
@end example

There's no constraint on function names, but they must be one--word
names.

Before running a test function: the current process working directory is
saved, and it is restored after the execution is terminated.

The return value of the test functions is used as result of the test:
true, the test succeeded; false, the test failed.  Remembering that the
return value of a function is the return value of its last executed
command, the functions @func{dotest-equal} and @func{dotest-output}, and
of course the @command{test} command, may be used to return the correct
value.
@end defun


Messages are printed before and after the execution of each function,
according to the mode selected with: @func{dotest-set-report-success},
@func{dotest-set-report-start}, @dots{}  @ref{testing config,
Configuring the package}

The following environment variables will influence the behaviour of
@func{dotest}.


@defvar TESTMATCH
Restrict the @var{pattern} argument to @func{dotest}.  First function names are matched against
@var{pattern}, then, the ones that match, are matched against @env{TESTMATCH}.
@end defvar


@defvar TESTSTART
If @code{yes}: It is equivalent to invoking
@func{dotest-set-report-start}.  If @code{no}: It is equivalent to
invoking @func{dotest-unset-report-start}.
@end defvar


@defvar TESTSUCCESS
If @code{yes}: It is equivalent to invoking
@func{dotest-set-report-success}.  If @code{no}: It is equivalent to
invoking @func{dotest-unset-report-success}.
@end defvar

@c page
@node testing compare
@section Validating results by comparing


@defun dotest-equal @var{expected} @var{got}
Compare the two parameters and return true if they are equal; return
false otherwise.  In the latter case print a message showing the
expected value and the wrong one.  Must be used as last command in a
function, so that its return value is equal to that of the function.
@end defun


Example:

@example
function my-func () @{
    echo $(($1 + $2))
@}
function mytest-1.1 () @{
    dotest-result 5 `my-func 2 3`
@}

@}
dotest mytest-
@end example

@c page
@node testing output
@section Validating results by output


@defun dotest-output
@defunx dotest-output @var{string}
Read all the available lines from stdin accumulating them into a local
variable, separated by @code{\n}; then compare the input with
@var{string}, or the empty string if @var{string} is not present, and
return true if they are equal, false otherwise.
@end defun


Example of test for a function that echoes its three parameters:

@example

    echo $1 $2 $3
@}
function mytest-1.1 () @{
    my-lib-function a b c | dotest-output "a b c"

@section Handling files in tests


In this section are described functions to be used to create temporary
files; it is a common task to write scripts to manipulate files and
directories.  All the files should be created under a temporary
directory that must be removed after each test function is invoked; the
library automatically invokes @func{dotest-clean-files} when exiting
(using @code{trap}), but it is safer to invoke it at the end of each
function that creates files.

@subsection Directories


@defun dotest-cd @var{directory}
Change the working directory.  This is just a wrapper for @command{cd};
if verbose mode is on: print a message.
@end defun


@defun dotest-mkdir @var{directory}
@defunx dotest-mkdir @var{directory} @var{prefix}
Create @var{directory} under the temporary directory; @var{directory}
must be a relative pathname (that is: it must not begin with a slash).

The optional @var{prefix} is a relative pathname that is prepended to
@var{directory}: it is useful to prepend the name of a parent directory.

Print to stdout the full pathname of the directory.
@end defun


@subsubheading Temporary directory

@defun dotest-echo-tmpdir
Print the value of the temporary directory in which all the files and
directories will be created.  The value is prefixed with the value of
the environment variable @env{TMPDIR}, or @file{/tmp} if not set.
@end defun


@defun dotest-cd-tmpdir
Change the working directory to the temporary directory.
@end defun


@defun dotest-mktmpdir
Create the temporary directory.  @func{dotest-mkdir} creates the temporary directory automatically
by using the @option{--parents} option of @command{mkdir}.  This function is automatically invoked
by @func{dotest-mkfile} and @func{dotest-mkpathname}.

that is prepended to @var{pathname}: It is useful to prepend the name of
a parent directory.  Print to stdout the full pathname of the file.
@end defun


@defun dotest-clean-files
Remove the temporary directory and all its children.  Should be invoked
at the end of each function that creates temporary files or directories.

Return the value of the last command executed before the invocation,
that way it can be used right after @func{dotest-output} and
@func{dotest-equal} without loosing the return value of the function.
@end defun


@defun dotest-mkpathname @var{pathname}
@defunx dotest-mkpathname @var{pathname} @var{prefix}
Compose a pathname under the temporary testing directory.  The optional @var{prefix} is a relative
pathname that is prepended to @var{pathname}: It is useful to prepend the name of a parent
directory.  Print to stdout the full pathname of the file.

This function invokes @func{dotest-mktmpdir}.

First we examine plain scripts (making no use of @mbfl{}) to understand the basics of how to handle
the @smtp{} protocol and how to ``talk'' to a process in background.

Then we see the documentation of a complex script, @command{sendmail-mbfl.sh}, which we can use to
send email with plain or encrypted connections.

Finally we see how to use the @gnu{} Emacs interface to the script, @file{sendmail-mbfl.el}.

@appendixsec How to compose a test email message


Here we discuss how to programmatically compose a minimal email message to be used in testing email
scripts.  Basically a message should look like this:

@example
Sender: marco@@localhost
From: marco@@localhost
To: root@@localhost
Subject: demo from sendmail-plain.sh
Message-ID: <15704-6692-23464@@this.hostname>
Date: Tue, 28 Apr 2009 06:16:01 +0200

This is a text demo from the sendmail-plain.sh script.
--
Marco
@end example

We have to remember that the @smtp{} server receiving the message may rewrite the addresses, for
example: replacing @code{localhost} with the fully qualified local host name (the output of the
command @command{hostname --fqdn}); so, when reading the delivered message, we do not have to be
surprised to find changed addresses.

We want to notice the following:

@itemize
@item
The fully qualified local host name is useful to build header values.  We can acquire it with the
@command{hostname} command like this:

@example
LOCAL_HOSTNAME=$(hostname --fqdn)
@end example

@noindent
do not confuse this value with the host name of the @smtp{} server!

@item
The value of the @code{Message-ID} header must be enclosed in angular parentheses, and it must
contain an address--like string with random characters in the name part.  We can generate it with:

@example
printf -v MESSAGE_ID '%d-%d-%d@@%s' \
    $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM "$LOCAL_HOSTNAME"
@end example

@noindent
or with:

@example
printf -v MESSAGE_ID '%s@@%s'                   \
    $(@{ IFS= read -n 15 line </dev/random      \
         echo "$line" ; @} |                    \
         md5sum --binary | cut -f1 -d' ')      \
    "$LOCAL_HOSTNAME"
@end example

@item
The value of the @code{Date} header must be the current date in a specified format.  We can generate
it using the @gnu{} Date program like this:

@example
DATE=$(date --rfc-2822) || exit 2
@end example

@item
In the body of the message: the string that separates the text from the signature is the three
characters string @code{-- } (dash, dash, white space).  When composing the message we have to be
careful to use commands that @strong{do not} drop white spaces.
@end itemize

In the end, we can use the following chunk of code to compose an email message:

@example
PROGNAME=$@{0##*/@}
FROM_ADDRESS=marco@@localhost
TO_ADDRESS=root@@localhost

function print_message () @{
    local LOCAL_HOSTNAME DATE MESSAGE_ID MESSAGE
    LOCAL_HOSTNAME=$(hostname --fqdn) || exit 2
    DATE=$(date --rfc-2822) || exit 2
    printf -v MESSAGE_ID '%d-%d-%d@@%s' \
        $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM "$LOCAL_HOSTNAME"
    MESSAGE="Sender: $FROM_ADDRESS
From: $FROM_ADDRESS
To: $TO_ADDRESS
Subject: demo from $PROGNAME
Message-ID: <$MESSAGE_ID>
Date: $DATE

This is a text demo from the $PROGNAME script.
--\x20
Marco
"
    printf "$MESSAGE"
@}
@end example

@noindent
notice that to put the required single white space character in the text/signature separator we use
the escape sequence @code{\x20} (where 20 is the hexadecimal value of the white space character in
the @ascii{} encoding) and print the message with @code{printf}, which expands the escape sequences.

When sending the message to the @smtp{} server we have to:

@itemize
@item
Be careful in not to wrongly modify it.

@item
Send it one line at a time, terminating each line with a carriage return, line feed sequence
(@code{\r\n}).

@item
Quote with a dot lines starting with a dot.
@end itemize

So we can use an equivalent of the following chunk of code, assuming @code{3} is the file descriptor
connected to the remote @smtp{} server:

@example
print_message | while IFS= read line
do
    if test "$@{line:0:1@}" = '.'
    then printf '.%s\r\n' "$line" >&3
    else printf  '%s\r\n' "$line" >&3
    fi
done
@end example

@noindent
notice that @code{read} is executed in an environment in which @code{IFS} is set to the empty
string, this is to prevent unwanted modification of the message text.  @code{read} splits the string
it reads into words according to the current value of @code{IFS}, and this may lead to mutation of
the input string; word splitting happens when there is a single output variable, too.  To prevent
word splitting, we set @code{IFS} to the empty string.

/dev/tcp/localhost/25
@end example

@noindent
where 25 is the @tcp{} port which is officially assigned to the @smtp{} service.  To open the
connection we use the idiom:

@example
exec 3<>/dev/tcp/localhost/25
@end example

@noindent
which means: open a read and write connection to the selected hostname, using file descriptor number
3.  There is nothing special in number 3, it is just the first free file descriptor number after 0
(standard input), 1 (standard output) and 2 (standard error).

The line:

@example
trap 'exec 3<&-' EXIT
@end example

@noindent
means: close file descriptor 3 whenever the script terminates.  This is redundant in such a simple
script, it is there for completeness.
@end defun


@defun send @var{string}
@defunx send @var{template} [@var{opt} @dots{}]
Send a string to the @smtp{} server.  Use @func{printf} to format the string @var{template} with
the optional arguments, then write the resulting string to file descriptor 3.  The string written
out is terminated with the sequence @code{\r\n} as mandated by the @smtp{} protocol.
@end defun


@defun read_and_send_message
Read an email message from stdin line by line (newline terminator), and rewrite it to file
descriptor 3 terminating each line with the sequence carriage return/line feed.  With the exception
of the terminating sequence, the lines are left unchanged.
@end defun


@defun recv @var{expected_code}
Read a line (a sequence of characters up until the first @code{\n}) from file descriptor 3.  The
line is interpreted as a message from the @smtp{} server: the first three characters are a numeric
code.  If the code is different from @var{expected_code}, raise an error.

@appendixsec Send email through a process in background


The script below can be found in @file{examples/sendmail-connector.sh}.  It just sends a hard--coded
email message, from a hard--coded address to a hard--coded address.  It makes no use of @mbfl{}.

@quotation
Bash version 4 introduced the new keyword @code{coproc}, which can be used to spawn processes in
background and talk to them via pipes.  This keyword in @strong{not} used in this appendix.
@end quotation

The purpose of the script is to understand how to send a message through a process in background.
It does the same things of the example described in @ref{sendmail plain, Just send an email
message}.  The main difference is that the single function @func{open_session} is replaced by the
two functions @func{open_session} and @func{connector}.

What is important to understand, is how @func{open_session} runs @func{connector} in background
and sets up two file descriptors to talk to it.  In the real world we never use this technique with
a function; this example script makes use of @func{connector} as a replacement for an external
program that can establish sophisticated connections to remote hosts, for example using the
@tls{}/@ssl{} protocols.


@defun open_session @var{hostname}
Open a connection to the @smtp{} server spawning a background process represented by the
@func{connector} function.  It makes use of two @fifo{}s (First In, First Out).

If we were to do it from a C language program: we would use the @cfunc{pipe} system function to
create two pipes connecting script's process to the background process.

@example
 ---------  out pipe  -----------  socket  --------
| script  |--------->| connector |<======>| SMTP   |
| process |<---------| process   |        | server |
 ---------  in pipe   -----------          --------
@end example

Bash has no way to create a pipe using the @cfunc{pipe} system function (up until version 4), so we
use two @fifo{} channels created by the @command{mkfifo} program:

@example
: $@{TMPDIR:=/tmp@}
local INFIFO=$@{TMPDIR@}/in.$$
local OUFIFO=$@{TMPDIR@}/out.$$

mkfifo --mode=0600 $INFIFO $OUFIFO
@end example

@noindent
the script will use @code{INFIFO} to read characters from @func{connector}, and @code{OUFIFO} to
send characters to @func{connector}.

@example
 ---------  OUFIFO   -----------  socket  --------
| script  |-------->| connector |<======>| SMTP   |
| process |<--------| process   |        | server |
 ---------  INFIFO   -----------          --------
@end example

Once the @fifo{}s exist on the file system, we run @func{connector} in background, connecting its
standard input and output to the @fifo{}s:

@example
connector $HOSTNAME $SMTP_PORT <$OUFIFO >$INFIFO &
@end example

@noindent
be careful in selecting the redirections.  Notice that, in this simple example, we ignore errors
running @func{connector}.

Now we open file descriptors connecting them to the @fifo{}s:

@example
exec 3<>$INFIFO 4>$OUFIFO
@end example

@noindent
the script will use file descriptor 3 to read characters from @func{connector}, and file descriptor
4 to send characters to @func{connector}.  We open the input @fifo{} for both reading and writing,
else @code{exec} will block waiting for the first char.

We have connected both the ends of both the @fifo{}s, so we can remove them from the file system:

@example
rm $INFIFO $OUFIFO
@end example

@noindent
the @fifo{}s will continue to exist in the OS kernel until the file descriptors are closed.

Finally we register a clean up handler that closes the descriptors:

@example
trap 'exec 3<&- 4>&-' EXIT
@end example
@end defun


@defun connector @var{hostname}
Establish a connection to the @smtp{} server at @var{hostname}.  It is not important here to fully
understand how this function works; suffice it to say that it reads lines from stdin, and echoes
them to the server; it reads lines from the server, and echoes them to stdout.

@appendixsec Using @command{gnutls-cli} as connector


@gnu{} @tls{} is a library implementing the @tls{} protocol; we can use it to establish encrypted
and authenticated connections to a remote host.  The @smtp{} protocol has extensions to allow usage
of a @tls{} layer.

A @gnu{} @tls{} installation comes with a command line test program, @command{gnutls-cli}, that can
establish an encrypted connection.  We use this command as the ``connector'' modeled in
@ref{sendmail connector, Send email through a process in background}.  It has a manual page, which
we may want to read.

When handling an encrypted connection we have to know in advance how the remote @smtp{} server
behaves.  Let's see first the simpler example, using the a human driven interactive session; then we
will describe a more complex interaction.

@quotation
Notice that @command{gnutls-cli} has a @option{--crlf} option that will cause all the lines sent to
the server to be terminated by a carriage return/line feed sequence (@code{\r\n} or
@code{\x0d\x0a}).  If we write a script that terminates by itself the lines with this sequence, for
example:

@example
printf 'ehlo localhost.localdomain\r\n'
@end example

@noindent
we must @strong{avoid} this option, else @smtp{} protocol violation errors may occur.  However, if
we try a hand--driven interactive session, we want to use this option to send protocol--compliant
lines.

@appendixsubsec Immediate encrypted bridge


We use as example the server @code{relay.poste.it}, port @code{465}.  You have to have an account
there to use it; do not bomb this server with fake connections.  This server requests us to build
the encrypted bridge immediately after the connection has been established, without waiting for any
line of greetings from the server.

So, we start the connector like this:

@example
$ gnutls-cli --port 465 relay.poste.it
@end example

@noindent
if the connection succeeds: @command{gnutls-cli} prints a lot of message lines on its standard
output explaining what is going on; at last comes the line of greetings from the server, which
begins with code @code{220}.

The server supports the @code{AUTH LOGIN} authentication mechanism, which requires the base64
encoding of the user name and password; we can perform it with the external program @command{base64}
(which comes with @gnu{} Coreutils) like this:

@example
ENCODED_USERNAME=$(echo -n 'the-user-name' | base64)
ENCODED_PASSWORD=$(echo -n 'the-pass-word' | base64)
@end example

@noindent
@gnu{} Emacs users can do it with:

@example
(setq my-usr (base64-encode-string "the-user-name"))
(setq my-pwd (base64-encode-string "the-pass-word"))
@end example

@noindent
The authentication dialogue goes like this:

@enumerate
@item
We send @code{AUTH LOGIN}, to start the authentication.

@item
It replies with @code{334 VXNlcm5hbWU6} which is the request for the username.  The string
@code{VXNlcm5hbWU6} is the base64 encoding of the string @code{Username:} (without trailing
newline); we can verify this with:

@example
$ echo -n Username: | base64
@end example

@noindent
or in the Emacs' scratch buffer:

@example
(base64-encode-string "Username:")
@end example

@item
We send the login user name encoded in base64.

@item
It checks the string and, if the format is correct, it replies with @code{334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6} (this
should happen even if the username is unknown to the server).  The string @code{UGFzc3dvcmQ6} is the
base64 encoding of the string @code{Password:} (without ending newline); we can verify this with:

@example
$ echo -n Password: | base64
@end example

@noindent
or in the Emacs' scratch buffer:

@example
(base64-encode-string "Password:")
@end example

@item
We send the login password encoded in base64.

@item
It checks it and, if correct, it replies with a line starting with code @code{235}.
@end enumerate

@noindent
Beware that if we are not quick to send the encoded password after the encoded user name, the server
may reset the authentication process as if we sent a wrong user name.


So we can do the @smtp{} dialogue reported below by hand (which is an edited log of a session under
Emacs' eshell); lines starting with @code{recv>} are the ones received from the server, lines
starting with @code{send>} are the ones we send to the server, the ellipses @code{...}  are
replacements for server text we are not interested in.

@appendixsubsec Delayed encrypted bridge


We use as example the server @code{smtp.gmail.com}, port @code{587}.  You have to have an account
there to use it; do not bomb this server with fake connections.  This server requests us to start an
@code{ESMTP} dialogue, then issue the @code{STARTTLS} command and build the encrypted bridge; once
the bridge is set up, we restart an @code{ESMTP} dialogue and do the authentication and the message
delivery.

We start the connector like this:

@example
$ gnutls-cli --starttls --port 587 smtp.gmail.com
@end example

@noindent
if the connection succeeds: @command{gnutls-cli} prints message lines on its standard output
explaining what is going on; at last comes the line of greetings from the server, which begins with
code @code{220}.

The @option{--starttls} option tells @command{gnutls-cli} @strong{not} to build the encrypted bridge
immediately; rather, it waits for a @code{SIGALRM} signal, which we must deliver to it when we are
ready.  The quickest way to send such a signal, when there is only one @command{gnutls-cli} process
running, is:

@example
$ kill -SIGALRM $(/sbin/pidof gnutls-cli)
@end example

@noindent
beware that @command{pidof} may be installed in other places on your system.

The server supports the @code{AUTH PLAIN} authentication mechanism, which requires the base64
encoding of the user name and password stored in a special record; we can do it with the external
program @command{base64} (which comes with @gnu{} Coreutils) like this:

@example
SECRETS=$(printf "\x00%s\x00%s" \
   "$@{LOGIN_NAME@}" "$@{PASSWORD@}" | base64)
@end example

@noindent
@gnu{} Emacs users can do it with:

@example
(setq my-auth (base64-encode-string
   (format "%c%s%c%s" 0 "the-user-name" 0 "the-pass-word")))
@end example

@noindent
The authentication dialogue goes like this:

@enumerate
@item
We send @code{AUTH PLAIN} followed by the encoded credentials.

@item
It checks the user name and password and, if correct, it replies with code @code{235}.
@end enumerate

@appendixsec Using @command{openssl} as connector


OpenSSL is a library implementing the @ssl{}/@tls{} protocol; we can use it to establish encrypted
and authenticated connections to a remote host.

An OpenSSL installation comes with a command line test program, @command{openssl}, that can
establish an encrypted connection.  We use this command as the ``connector'' modeled in
@ref{sendmail connector, Send email through a process in background}.  It has a manual page, which
we may want to read.

Here we see how we can use the @command{openssl} program in place of the @command{gnutls-cli}
program described in @ref{sendmail gnutls, Using @command{gnutls-cli} as connector}.  The two
methods have a lot in common (the @smtp{} protocol is the same), we only have to understand the
command line of the program.

@quotation
Notice that @command{openssl} has a @option{-crlf} option that will cause all the lines sent to the
server to be terminated by a carriage return/line feed sequence (@code{\r\n} or @code{\x0d\x0a}).
If we write a script that terminates by itself the lines with this sequence, for example:

@example
printf 'ehlo localhost.localdomain\r\n'
@end example

@noindent
we must @strong{avoid} this option, else @smtp{} protocol violation errors may occur.  However, if

This section documents the example script @file{examples/sendmail-mbfl.sh}, which makes use of

@appendixsubsec Usage examples


Let's say we have a file named @file{message.mail} holding a fully composed email message:

@example
Sender: marco@@localhost
From: marco@@localhost
To: root@@localhost
Subject: server on fire?

I noticed flames raising from the server room...
--
Marco
@end example

@noindent
basically, to send it with @command{sendmail-mbfl.sh} we have to do:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh \
    --envelope-from=marco@@localhost  \
    --envelope-to=root@@localhost     \
    --message=message.mail
@end example

@noindent
by default the @smtp{} server name is set to @code{localhost} and the @tcp{} port to @code{25}.  The
default session is plain, without @tls{}.

Port number @code{25} is officially assigned to the @smtp{} protocol; if the localhost uses a
different @tcp{} port, we can select it with the @option{--port} option:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh --port=587         \
    --envelope-from=marco@@localhost   \
    --envelope-to=root@@localhost      \
    --message=message.mail
@end example

To send mail to a remote @smtp{} server, we select its hostname with the @option{--host} option:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh \
    --host=smtp.gmail.com --port=587  \
    --envelope-from=marco@@gmail.com   \
    --envelope-to=marco@@spiffy.it     \
    --message=message.mail
@end example

Mail services may offer encrypted sessions to their @smtp{} servers.  Encryption with the @tls{}
protocol is supported by @command{sendmail-mbfl.sh} through external programs.  Whether a server
requires an encrypted session, can be specified using the @option{--plain}, @option{--tls} or
@option{--starttls} options.

To establish an encrypted session, the script needs to acquire the credentials of the user.  These
can be stored in a configuration file named @file{~/.mbfl-authinfo}, which looks like this:

@smallexample
machine smtp.gmail.com login marco@@gmail.com password abcdefghilm
machine relay.poste.it login marco@@poste.it  password 0123456789
@end smallexample

@noindent
so that a line/record can be uniquely identified with values of the @option{--host} and
@option{--username} options.

So we can do:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh --host=gmail       \
    --username=marco --starttls        \
    --envelope-from=marco@@gmail.com   \
    --envelope-to=marco@@spiffy.it     \
    --message=message.mail

Select the @code{MAIL FROM} envelope address.  If this option is used multiple times: the last one
wins.

@item -T@var{address}
@itemx --envelope-to=@var{address}
Select the @code{RCPT TO} envelope address.  This option can be used multiple times: each
@var{address} is appended to a list of recipients.

@item -M@var{source}
@itemx --message=@var{source}
Select the source of the whole email message.  If @var{source} is a file pathname, that file is read
and used as data; if @var{source} is @code{-}, the message is read from the standard input channel.
It defaults to @code{-}.

@item --test-message
Send a test message with a hard--coded body part.  This option supersedes @option{--message}.

@item --host=@var{host}
Select the @smtp{} server host name.  It defaults to @code{localhost}.

@item --host-info=@var{file}
Select a file from which to read host and port informations.

@item -p@var{port}
@itemx --port=@var{port}
Select the @smtp{} server @tcp{} port; this option supersedes @option{--host-info}.  It defaults to
@code{25}.

@item --plain
@itemx --tls
@itemx --starttls
Establish a plain session, @tls{} session with immediate bridge construction or @tls{} session with
bridge construction after @code{STARTTLS} command.

@item --gnutls
Use @command{gnutls-cli} as connector for encrypted sessions.  This is the default when
@option{--tls} or @option{--starttls} are used.

@item --openssl
Use @command{gnutls-cli} as connector for encrypted sessions.

@item --auth-info=@var{file}
Select the file, in @code{netrc} format, from which to read the authorisation credentials.  Defaults
to @file{~/.mbfl-authinfo}.

@item --username=@var{user}
Specify a string used to select an account in the authorisation file.  @var{user} must be a
substring of the username present in the file, the first matching line from the file is selected.
So, if the authinfo file is:

@example
machine smtp.gmail.com login mrc.mgg@@gmail.com password <password>
machine relay.poste.it login marco.maggi-ipsu password <password>
@end example

@noindent
we can use @option{--username=mrc.mgg} to select the first line and @option{marco.maggi} to select
the second line.

@item --auth-none
@itemx --auth-plain
@itemx --auth-login
Perform no authorisation, the @code{AUTH PLAIN} authorisation or the @code{AUTH LOGIN}
authorisation.
@end table

@c page
@node sendmail script hostinfo
@appendixsubsec Reading host informations from file


For each @smtp{} server we need the following informations: the hostname, the port number, the
session type, the authorisation method.  There are two ways to specify these:

@itemize
@item
Use the command line options as in:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh \
    --host=smtp.gmail.org --port=587    \
    --tls --auth-login                  \
    ...
@end example

@item
Use the hostinfo file and the option @option{--host} to select a record into it, as in:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh --host=smtp.gmail.org ...

$ sendmail-mbfl.sh --host=smtp.gmail.org \
    --host-info=~/.hostrc ...
@end example
@end itemize

@noindent
If @option{--host} is not used: the hostname defaults to @code{localhost}.  If the selection of
port, session type or authorisation type is left unspecified: The script automatically looks into
the default hostinfo file.  Informations from command line options supersede informations from the
hostinfo file.

The default pathname for the hostinfo file is @file{$HOME/.mbfl-hostinfo} and can be overridden by
the @option{--host-info} option.  The format of this file is line oriented: Blank lines are ignored,
lines starting with a @code{#} character are comments, lines starting with @code{machine} are host
records.

Each record line must have the format:

@smallexample
machine <host> service <name> port <number> session <type> auth <type>
@end smallexample

@noindent
for example:

@smallexample
# ~/.mbfl-hostinfo --
#

# SMTP servers
machine localhost service smtp port 25 session plain auth none
machine relay.poste.it service smtp port 465 session tls auth login
machine smtp.gmail.com service smtp port 587 session starttls auth plain

# POP3 servers

@node sendmail script authinfo
@appendixsubsec Reading authentication credentials from file


The only way the script has to acquire the user name and password to log into the remote server, is
by reading the authinfo file.  By default, its pathname is @file{$HOME/.mbfl-authinfo}, it can be
overridden with the @option{--auth-info} option.

Its format is a simplified version of the @code{netrc} file format: blank lines are ignored, lines
starting with a @code{#} character are comments, lines starting with @code{machine} are host
records.

Each record must have the format:

@example
machine <hostname> login <user-name> password <pass-word>
@end example

@noindent
for example:

@example
machine smtp.gmail.com login one@@gmail.com password abcdefghilm
machine relay.poste.it login two@@poste.it  password 0123456789
@end example

@noindent
so that we can extract a record with the following script:

@example
file=~/.mbfl-authinfo
host=poste
username=marco

rex='^[ \t]*'
rex+='machine[ \t]\+.*%s.*[ \t]\+'
rex+='login[ \t]\+.*%s.*[ \t]\+'
rex+='password[ \t]\+.*'
rex+='[ \t]*$'
rex=$(printf "$rex" $host $username)

line=$(grep "$rex" $file)
set -- $line
echo machine  $2
echo username $4
echo password $6
@end example

@noindent
currently @command{sendmail-mbfl.sh} parses the file using the @code{=~} regular expressions
operator.

The host name and the user name are selected by the command line options @option{--host} and
@option{--username}.  Notice that the values for these options can be substrings of the values in
the authinfo file.

@node sendmail script emacs
@appendixsubsec Interfacing with @gnu{} Emacs


This section documents an Emacs interface to the
@command{sendmail-mbfl.sh} script that can be used to send mail.  It
consists of an Emacs Lisp library that allows us to send mail with all
the methods supported by the script.

To use it we have to install the file @file{examples/sendmail-mbfl.el}
in one of the directories in the load path of Emacs, then load it with:

@example
(require 'sendmail-mbfl)
@end example

The library assumes that @file{message.el} and @file{sendmail.el} are
available on the system; recent installations of Emacs should have them.
