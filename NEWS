	       Changes to Marco's Bash Functions Library
	       =========================================


Notes for revision 3.0.0-devel.0
--------------------------------

This release  has some backwards  incompatibilities.  Watch out  for the
changes!

* Officially this package now required GNU Bash at least version 4.3.

* Package building and installing  infrastructure review.  The files are
  installed under directories *without* the version part.  No pkg-config
  module is installed.

* The  way  the library  is  reliably  loaded  has been  reviewed.   The
  preprocessor can include the needed code with a macro.

* The quoting for m4 preprocessing is changed from:

     m4_changequote(`[[', `]]')

  to:

     m4_changequote(`[[[', `]]]')

* Added preprocessor macros to  automatically include the library loader
  and automatically embed the whole library in the output script.

* Added some  "_var" variants  to functions.   For example  two variants
  exist to extract the filename extension:

    mbfl_file_extension
    mbfl_file_extension_var

  the first  variant will print the  result to stdout, while  the "_var"
  variant will store the result in a variable whose name is handed to it
  as first argument.  Example:

    mbfl_file_extension /path/to/file.ext
    -| ext

    local RV
    mbfl_file_extension_var RV /path/to/file.ext
    "$RV"  => ext

  The "_var" variants are always a bit faster because the output variant
  is a wrapper for the "_var" variant.

* Added to the preprocessor some  facilities needed to declare variables
  with unique names and use them as target for variable with the NAMEREF
  attribute.  With  these facilities we  can use the "_var"  variants of
  MBFL functions as follows:

     mbfl_local_varref(RV)

     mbfl_file_extension_var mbfl_varname(RV) /path/to/file.ext
     "$RV" @result{} ext

  without risking a variable name collision.

* Added string functions:

    mbfl_string_is_empty
    mbfl_string_is_not_empty
    mbfl_string_length
    mbfl_string_length_equal_to
    mbfl_string_equal
    mbfl_string_not_equal
    mbfl_string_less
    mbfl_string_greater
    mbfl_string_less_or_equal
    mbfl_string_greater_or_equal
    mbfl_string_split_blanks
    mbfl_string_toupper_var
    mbfl_string_tolower_var
    mbfl_string_is_email_address
    mbfl_string_is_network_hostname
    mbfl_string_is_network_port
    mbfl_string_is_network_ip_address
    mbfl_string_is_yes
    mbfl_string_is_no
    mbfl_string_strip_carriage_return_var

* Added times and dates module.

* Added functions to the file module:

    mbfl_file_realpath
    mbfl_file_realpath_var

* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY The following  functions now use the program
  "stat":

    mbfl_file_get_owner
    mbfl_file_get_group
    mbfl_file_get_size

* Added  function "mbfl_exec_tar".   The  old  "mbfl_tar_exec" is  still
  there but is deprecated.

* BACKWARDS  INCOMPATIBILITY  The  functions  "mbfl_file_set_owner"  and
  "mbfl_file_set_group" do  not honour  the "--verbose"  option anymore.
  However they  accept options  to be  used on the  command line  of the
  underlying programs.

* Added support to compress/decompress with lzip and xz.

* Added functions to the program module:

    mbfl_program_split_path

* Started arrays module.

* Added  functions  to  the  system   module  to  inspect  entries  from
  /etc/passwd and /etc/group.

* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY The function "exit_because_invalid_username"
  has been renamed to "exit_because_invalid_sudo_username".

* Added locations module.

* Added module "atexit" implementing atexit handlers.

* Started interface to "stat" from GNU Coreutils.

* Added module "fd" implementing file descriptors handlers.


Notes for revision 2.2.0
------------------------

* Added file functions to change owner and group.


Notes for revision 2.1b0
------------------------

* This is meant to be a beta release.

* The program module now uses numeric file descriptors: when a script is
  run  from  a  Cron  job,  it appears  no  aliases  are  available  (no
  /dev/stdin, /dev/fd/0, et cetera).


Notes for revision 2.1d0
------------------------

* Added functions:

     mbfl_string_is_extended_identifier
     mbfl_string_is_extended_identifier_char

* Rewritten support for running programs through sudo.

* For  sendmail-mbfl:  renamed  files  ".hostinfo"  and  ".authinfo"  to
  ".mbfl-hostinfo" and ".mbfl-authinfo".


Notes for revision 2.0b0
------------------------

* Fixed  "mbfl_string_is_*"  functions  to  accept an  empty  string  as
  argument and return with error status.

* Added function "mbfl_program_replace".


Notes for revision 2.0d1
------------------------

* BACKWARDS  INCOMPATIBILITY The  preprocessor macros  are now  prefixed
  with "mbfl_".

* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY  The getopts  module raises  an error  if an
  option with argument is used with an empty value.

* BACKWARDS   INCOMPATIBILITY  The   predefined   command  line   option
  "--print-action-arguments" does not exist anymore.

* BACKWARDS   INCOMPATIBILITY  The   predefined  command   line  options
  "--license", "--version", etc. do not  exit immediately in the getopts
  module;  rather they  register a  function to  be called  by the  main
  module.  So  the selected "after  parsing options" function  is called
  before exiting.

* BACKWARDS      INCOMPATIBILITY       The      deprecated      function
  "mbfl_program_check()" has been removed.

* The global variables: ARGC1, ARGV1,  ARGC, ARGV are no more read-only;
  ugly, but it allows test suites to use them.

* Added module "actions" implementing a tree of script actions.
