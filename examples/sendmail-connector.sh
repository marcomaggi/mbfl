# Date: Thu Apr 23, 2009
#
# Abstract
#
#       This  script  just  sends  a  hardcoded  email  message  from  a
#       hardcoded address  to a hardcoded  address.  It makes no  use of
#       MBFL.
#
#         The purpose  of this  script is  to understand  how to  send a
#       message through a process in background.
