;;; Commentary:

;; This  module implements  a  method  of sending  email  messages to  a
;; SMTP/ESMTP server using an  external program.  It supports plain SMTP
;; session as well as sessions encrypted with the SSL/TLS protocol.
;;
;; To handle the encrypted layer  it can use both the "openssl" program,
;; distributed with  OpenSSL, and the  "gnutls-cli" program, distributed
;; with GNU TLS.
;;
;; The encrypted  layer does NOT support  certificate authentication, so
;; it is vulnerable to certain attacks.  It can be used, though, to send
;; email to public email services like Gmail.
;;
;; The core of this module is an interface function which interprets the
;; current buffer  contents as an email  message and sends  it using the
;; "sendmail-mbfl.sh" GNU Bash script distributed with MBFL.
;;
;; The function  `send-mail-with-mbfl' can be invoked  directly from the
;; minibuffer,      or,     better,      used      as     value      for
;; `message-send-mail-function'.
;;
;; MBFL is  a library of  functions for the  GNU Bash shell.  It  can be
;; downloaded from:
;;
;;	http://gna.org/projects/mbfl
;;
;; while development takes place at:
;;
;;      http://github.com/marcomaggi/mbfl/tree/master
;;
;; the home page is:
;;
;;	http://marcomaggi.github.com/mbfl.html
;;
;; the  full  documentation of  the  script,  and  a discussion  of  its
;; internals, are available in the MBFL documentation in Texinfo format:

(defun send-mail-with-mbfl ()
  "Implement a method of sending email messages to a SMTP/ESMTP server using an external program.

It supports plain SMTP session as well as sessions encrypted with
the SSL/TLS protocol.

To handle  the encrypted  layer it can  use both  the \"openssl\"
program,  distributed   with  OpenSSL,  and   the  \"gnutls-cli\"
program, distributed with GNU TLS.

The encrypted layer  does NOT support certificate authentication,
so it is vulnerable to  certain attacks.  It can be used, though,
to send email to public email services like Gmail.

The core of this module is an interface function which interprets
the  current buffer  contents as  an email  message and  sends it
using the  \"sendmail-mbfl.sh\" GNU Bash  script distributed with
MBFL.

The function  `send-mail-with-mbfl' can be  invoked directly from
the    minibuffer,    or,    better,    used   as    value    for
`message-send-mail-function'.

MBFL is a library of functions for the GNU Bash shell.  It can be
downloaded from:

\thttp://gna.org/projects/mbfl

while development takes place at:

\thttp://github.com/marcomaggi/mbfl/tree/master

the home page is:

\thttp://marcomaggi.github.com/mbfl.html

the full  documentation of  the script, and  a discussion  of its
internals,  are available  in the  MBFL documentation  in Texinfo
format:

\thttp://marcomaggi.github.com/docs/mbfl.html"
